Baukasten is a game library which focuses on easy 2D(/3D) game development.
It is written in Go.
Baukasten is the german word for "construction kit".

WARNING! Baukasten is unstable/untested and contains new code. The API will change. Use at your on risk!
WARNING! Baukasten is also developed from an unprofessional developer who has no idea what he is doing!
WARNING! This can result in code which might work but not in a good way.

Baukasten is released under the MIT license.

Baukasten uses SDL (Window, input, audio) and OpenGL(drawing).

This is kind of the targeted API:

- Init(*GraphicSettings)
- Quit

- DrawLine(p1, p2 Vector2, Color)
- DrawLines([]Vector2, Color)
- DrawLineSegments([]Vector2, Color)
- DrawRectangle(Rectangle, Color)
- DrawPolygon([]Vector2)

- FillRectangle(Rectangle, Color)
- FillPolygon([]Vector2, Color)

- GradientRectangle(Rectangle, Gradient)
